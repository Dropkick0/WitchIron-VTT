"Witch Iron" is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) designed by Ethan Rowe with influences from other legendary games such as Zweihander, Dungeon Crawl Classics, The Burning Wheel, and more. It's under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, allowing users to freely share and adapt the material with proper attribution.

Core Mechanics:

Conflict Resolution: This includes 'Whatever’s Reasonable' (no roll needed if the outcome is reasonable), 'Ability or Skill Check' (roll for binary outcomes), and 'Quarrel' (roll for detailed or multiple outcomes).

Checks: Success is achieved by rolling percentile dice under a Skill or Ability. The tens digit of the roll on success becomes your number of hits (+ Hits). Failure is determined by rolling over the Skill or Ability, with the tens digit subtracted from your Skill or Ability to determine your number of hits.

Quarrels: Used to resolve conflicts. Parties agree on the terms, make a contested check, and then resolve the argument. The result depends on the net hits (-1 for failure, 0 to 2 for victory at a cost, and 3+ for clear victory).

Everything Wants to Kill You: The environment is an adversary, with hazards and goals that present minor to major quarrels. These include enemies, wilderness, storms, cities, diseases, and personal necessities like food, water, and sleep.

The Dark Descent: Players' lineages are doomed to demonic corruption. Players have the opportunity to learn a part of the demon's true name each generation, with the goal of either serving the dark gods or defeating the demon by learning its full name. Mechanisms include The Exchange (reroll any check with a cost), Naming the Beast (overcoming challenges to learn the demon's true name), Channel the Name (use the demon's powers), Damnation (transform into a powerful abomination at the cost of the descendant's soul), and the Ultimate Outcome (defeat or serve the demon).

The Bloody Axe: An example of a demon, boasting of fiery power and martial prowess. The demon's bloodline grants savage qualities and fear-inducing abilities. The demon has its own unique traits and influences which impact the player's character.

Creating a Foundry VTT System would require transferring these mechanics into a digital format, with automation for rolls, conflict resolution, tracking of demonic influences, and progression of the Dark Descent.
"Witch Iron" appears to be a Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) system, with a focus on demonic influence, true names, and character traits. The game involves demons, each possessing specific traits, and the discovery of their true names. The player characters are descendants of these demons and therefore have these traits.

Here's a summary:

Demonic Traits and Influence: Each demon has specific traits, and these are associated with a unique influence. Each demon also has a corresponding True Name that can be formed by choosing one option from each column (prefix, root, and suffix). The True Name is hidden and can be discovered in different ways.

Demon Examples: Some demons provided are:

"Demon of the Serpent of Vice" - known for temptation and indulgence.
"Demon of the Smiling Sickness" - spreads disease and decay.
Each demon has unique traits and influences, along with ways to discover its True Name.
Character Creation:

Step 1: Roll Starting Abilities (d20 ten times).
Step 2: Gain three Genetic Traits.
Step 3: Select two Lineages and add +10% to every listed Ability from each of your Lineages.
Luck: Players can spend Luck to modify their Check rolls or to escape a dangerous situation. At the end of every session, players gain a d10 Luck, up to 100.

Max Encumbrance: Over-encumbered characters suffer speed and check penalties.

Starting Abilities: Characters have primary and secondary abilities, including Muscle, Robustness, Agility, Quickness, Finesse, Intelligence, Willpower, Personality, and Luck.

Max Contacts/Followers: Characters have a maximum limit of Contacts (NPCs who indirectly assist) and Followers (NPCs who directly assist).

Skills and Specializations: Characters possess skills, each with different Specialization examples. Characters can gain bonus hits on successful checks within their specialization.

To create a Foundry VTT system from this, you would need to implement the various elements mentioned above, including the character creation rules, the skills, specializations, and the demonic traits and influences. Each demon could be a separate entity with its related traits, influence, and True Name mechanisms. The demonic influence could be modeled as conditions or effects applied to characters. The character sheet would need to accommodate for primary and secondary abilities, luck, encumbrance, contacts/followers, skills, and specializations.
Creating a Foundry VTT system for the "Witch Iron" TTRPG would involve programming and setting up various game mechanics, such as character traits, lineages, and descendant progression.

Here's a summary of the key elements:

Genetic Traits: These traits influence a character's abilities, and there are different traits for various aspects like Intelligence, Personality, Robustness, Finesse, Lifespan, Agility, Quickness, Luck, Willpower, Speed, and Magick or Faith. Each trait has a range (e.g., 25-32 for the "Dimwitted/Natural-Leader" trait, which influences Intelligence) and can be either increased or decreased by a certain percentage or value. The trait gained depends on if the roll is even or odd.

Passing Genes: Descendants can inherit their progenitor's genetic traits with a 50% chance or roll for a new trait. The order of the traits is significant.

Lines of Lineage: Each player chooses two lines of lineage that impact abilities (e.g., Academic, Alchemist, Black-Thumb, etc.). Each lineage provides bonuses to specific abilities and begins with two lineages unlocked. There are also unlockable lineages, which require fulfilling certain conditions.

Writing Your Book of Bones: Each descendant is recorded with a unique name and title based on their deeds or aspects of their life.

Starting and Unlockable Lineages: Each lineage provides unique bonuses and talents. To unlock a lineage, a descendant must gain all five lineage talents or complete a lineage-specific quest.

Lineage Projects: Each lineage can start a project (e.g., Academic's University, Alchemist's Guild), which provides benefits to the lineage descendants. The project's scale depends on the silver spent.

Lineage Talents: Each lineage has unique talents (e.g., Forbidden Inspiration for Academics, Devil’s Brew for Alchemist) which provide unique abilities or bonuses.

This system also includes elements like Descendant's life's work projects, which are only completed when a descendant dies, and each lineage has unique names for its guilds or institutions. All these aspects would need to be implemented in the Foundry VTT system.
Foundry VTT System Information for Witch Iron TTRPG
Talents
Quick Fixer: Once per session, allows prototyping inventions at a rate of 1 research point per minute and round instead of the usual 1 week and 1 day.
Contingency Plan: Once per session, allows pulling out any item up to one encumbrance after a trade check.
Explosive Device: Once per session, doubles effective research points when creating a new single-use weapon invention.
Perfectionist: Adds Tier in +Hits to crafting for a new Invention. Suffers one Stress for each Invention crafted this way.
Lineages
Black-Thumb: Invention-focused lineage. Can form a league of inventors and blacksmiths. Has costs and benefits depending on the league's rating.
Pit-Born: Combat-focused lineage. Can form a "Pit" for fighting. Has costs and benefits depending on the Pit's rating.
Ordained: Faith-focused lineage. Can construct a Temple. Has costs and benefits depending on the Temple's rating.
Shadow: Deception-focused lineage. No specific structure mentioned.
Lineage Unlocking Conditions
Black-Thumb: Submit a unique & impressive invention or die in defense of/conquer a League.
Pit-Born: Become champion of a Pit by defeating the current champion or die in defense of/conquer a Pit.
Ordained: Become ordained by donating a lost holy relic or die in defense of/conquer a Temple.
Descendants
Descendants can contribute to the league, pit, or temple of their lineage.
Descendants can earn +1 Tier by spending double training time.
Descendants can undertake lineage-specific projects that are completed upon their death.
Lineage-Specific Projects
Black-Thumb (Workshop): Allows creation of a Master Invention, a high-tier invention without any quirks.
Pit-Born (Uprising): Allows for the destruction of a Project or the gathering of a Warband.
Ordained (Sainthood): Allows creation of a holy relic that can cast miracles known by the descendant.
Costs and Benefits
Each lineage, league, pit, or temple has a rating system that determines its size, cost, and benefits. This should be implemented as a progression system in Foundry VTT.
Here's the summarization for creating a Foundry VTT system from the "Witch Iron" TTRPG:

Silver Cost and Scale: This refers to the cost in silver and the size of organizations. For example, a "Cutpurse Hideout" costs 1,000 silver and is of scale 1, while "The Dark Council" costs 512,000 silver and is of scale 10.

Syndicate Names: These are the possible names of syndicates, rolled on a d6.

Projects and Networks: Players can dedicate their life to a project for their lineage. A project's completion occurs upon the death of the player's character. Projects have costs associated with their tiers, which increase with each level.

Lineage Abilities and Talents: Characters from specific lineages gain bonus percentages to certain abilities and have access to specific talents. For example, a Witch gains +10% to Agility, Willpower, Personality, and Luck and can learn talents like Circle of Power or Fueled by Corruption.

Unlocking Lineages: Players can add specific lineages to their line by completing tasks, like joining a coven for the Witch lineage or passing a strength trial for the Workhorse lineage.

Lineage Projects: Lineage-specific projects offer benefits that stack with each rating. For instance, the Witch lineage has the Coven project, and the Workhorse lineage has the Club project.

Advancement: Characters earn one XP per silver spent. XP can be used to deepen bonds with the character's line, indulge in vices, work on legacy projects, crafting, trading, or training.

Training: Training allows characters to learn new talents, gain advancement points, and gain skill specializations. Training requires three months per tier and the total XP increases with each tier.

All these elements can be translated into Foundry VTT system modules, including elements like character sheets, dice rolling systems, and databases for syndicate names, lineage abilities, talents, and projects.
Witch Iron is a TTRPG with character progression that spans from Level 8 (Elite, 50,800 XP) to Level 10 (Living Legend, 409,200 XP).

Alchemy: Alchemists brew Concoctions using gathered ingredients. The process includes gathering ingredients, selecting effects based on Tier & Essence, and concocting for a week per Tier of effects. The result is a crude Concoction with a Toxicity level. This can be refined by making Research & Trade checks, reducing Toxicity per Hit. Concoctions have an instant effect or linger for d6 rounds, and can be extended at higher Tiers. After drinking, an Imbibe Check is made, subtracting Toxicity from Hits. If this results in 0 or less, the character suffers 1 Corruption. Concoctions are made from various Essences, each offering different effects and requiring different ingredients.

Inventing: Black-Thumbs can create Inventions. The process includes gathering ingredients (50s or 100s worth per Tier), selecting effects, and inventing for a week per Tier of effects. The result is a crude Invention with Quirks. This can be refined by making Research & Trade checks, reducing Quirks per Hit. Inventions can have different effects based on their type (Melee Weapons, Ranged Arms, Armor, Small Inventions).

Spell Writing: Those controlling Wicked Wind can write Spells. The process includes gathering ingredients (100s worth per Tier), selecting effects, and writing for a week per Tier of effects. The result is a crude spell with Quirks. This can be refined by making Research & Trade checks, reducing Quirks per Hit. Spells require Casting Hits to activate and can have different effects based on the Wicked Wind used.

Miracle Working: Devotees of a God can work Miracles. The process includes gathering ingredients (100s worth per Tier), selecting effects, and working for a week per Tier of effects. The result is a crude Miracle with Quirks. This can be refined by making Research & Trade checks, reducing Quirks per Hit. Miracles require Casting Hits to activate.

For Foundry VTT, this game would require modules for character progression, alchemy, inventing, spell writing, and miracle working, each with its unique mechanics and requirements.

Determine
Witch Iron TTRPG Foundry VTT System Summary:

Injury System:

Net Damage calculation: (Weapon Damage + Net Hits) - (Armor Value + Resistance Bonus)
Injury location and effects determined by the Net Damage on either arms/legs or non-living limbs.
Injury effects range from bruises to loss of limbs, inflicting conditions like Pain, Trauma, Bleed, and may require Healing or Surgery.
Non-living limbs do not suffer from Bleed or Pain conditions.
Mutation System:

Mutation occurs when Corruption sinks in. This reduces the character's Willpower by 10 and removes all Corruption.
Upon gaining a mutation, benefits could include bonus hits, special abilities, weapons, armor, movement, etc.
The nature of mutation is determined through rolls on the Mutation Table, combining different factors like living things, body parts, elements, functions, and miscellaneous factors.
Madness System:

Madness occurs when Stress overcomes the character. This reduces the character's Willpower by 10 and removes all Stress.
Upon gaining madness, benefits could include bonus hits, special abilities, weapons, armor, movement, etc.
The nature of madness is determined through rolls on the Madness Table, combining different factors like living things, emotions, objects, awakening, and miscellaneous factors.
For both the Mutation and Madness systems, if a character's Willpower reaches zero, they become a non-player character serving the Dark Gods.
"Witch Iron" is a tabletop RPG system that involves the casting of spells and dealing with the consequences of manipulating arcane forces.

Key Mechanics:

Casting Spells: When casting a spell, players roll up to their Magick value in d10s. The spell is cast successfully if the roll result equals or exceeds the spell's Casting Hits (CH). Spells can also be cast over multiple rounds in an Extended Check if the initial roll exceeds the CH.

Curse of the Wicked Winds: Miscasting can escalate depending on the number of Casting Checks made, ranging from a Petty Miscast to a Cataclysmic Miscast. The scale of the Miscast and its effects are determined by the Miscast tables.

Apprentice's Folly and Slow Death: Rolling a one on all dice results in a spell failure and a three-step Miscast escalation. Choosing not to roll for Miscast results in gaining Corruption.

Spellcasting Modifiers: Conditions and armor can affect spellcasting. Conditions like deafness impose a -1 penalty on Casting Checks, while heavier armors also impose a penalty.

Spontaneous Spells: This feature allows players to spontaneously cast spells by choosing one of three techniques ("I Create", "I Purge", "I Command") and combining it with a Domain of a wind they control. The effects of these spells depend on the amount of Casting Hits scored, affecting their scale, area, duration, and other parameters.

Magick Miscasts: There are three categories of miscasts: Petty, Great, and Cataclysmic, each with different potential outcomes when they occur.

Magick-Tainted: Players gain a Magick-Taint for every two Spells learned. Each Taint is based on a Domain of a Wind.

Winds and Domains: The system outlines specific "Winds", each with different Domains and Spells. Each Wind is associated with different thematic areas (e.g., the Blue Wind is associated with Weather & Fate, the Brown Wind with Beasts & Savagery, and the Gold Wind with Metal & Innovation).

The information provided includes a set of specific spells for each Wind and suggestions for spontaneously created spells at different CH values for each Wind. The effects of each spell and its Casting Hits (CH) requirement are described.

This system requires players to carefully manage their Magick use and risks while considering the thematic implications of their chosen Wind and its associated Domains. The system incorporates elements of luck, strategy, and risk management, emphasizing narrative and thematic coherence.
The wind harmonizes all elements.
+5
You can combine different magicks, creating a small mixed effect.
+10
You can utilize magick from different Winds to accomplish tasks with more precision.
+15
You can augment other spells with the power of multiple Winds.
+20
You can perfectly blend magicks to create a unique spell.
+25
You can create a powerful magickal effect that utilizes multiple Winds.
+30
You can create a massive magickal effect that draws power from all Winds.
+35
You can alter reality by combining the magicks of all Winds.
+40
You can create new magickal laws by combining the power of all Winds.
+45
You can create a new reality by perfectly blending the power of all Winds.
+50
You can ascend to a godlike state by perfectly utilizing the magicks of all Winds.

Each Wind (Green, Gray, Purple, Red, White, Defiled, Refined) provides unique spells and spontaneous magick abilities, with difficulty levels ranging from +0 to +50 in Witch Iron. For example, the Green Wind deals with nature and healing, while the Gray Wind focuses on illusion and thought manipulation. Spontaneous Magick outlines the effect you can achieve based on the difficulty level.

Each Wind spells have a CH value that likely represents the casting difficulty, and the effects can range from damage and control to healing and protection. They often have specific effects such as causing wounds, creating illusions, controlling targets, etc., and typically have a range, duration, and potentially additional mechanics like requiring a Quarrel (possibly some type of contest or save).

The Defiled and Refined Winds are special, requiring specific conditions to learn their spells. Defiled Winds spells always cause a Corruption Condition to the caster, while Refined Winds spells are harder to research.

The main mechanic for casting spells seems to involve rolls based on a number of six-sided dice (d6). There is mention of a Damage Roll, Wounds, Conditions, and Hits, indicating there may be a combat system in place as well.

In the Foundry VTT system, all these spells, abilities, and their effects can be coded as items or features that can be utilized by characters. The spells would have their CH value, description, and effects programmed into them. A mechanic would also be needed to represent the Spontaneous Magick system, possibly with a feature that enables characters to attempt a task at a chosen difficulty level, with the success and effect determined based on the roll against the CH value.

In addition, a combat system needs to be put in place to utilize the combat mechanics indicated in the spells. This system would need to include mechanics for resolving a Quarrel, applying and removing Conditions, determining Wounds, and handling other combat and non-combat interactions.

The system should also handle special rules like the Corruption Condition from Defiled Winds and the -10 CH to research Refined Winds spells. The Spontaneous Magick system could be implemented as a flexible casting system, where characters can attempt effects of a certain level based on the CH value.

Given the complexity of the Witch Iron rules, careful programming and testing would be required to ensure that all mechanics work together properly in the Foundry VTT system.
Witch Iron RPG for Foundry VTT System Summary

Magic and Faith System

Magic: This game features a tiered progression of magical powers, with each higher level granting a greater degree of control and manipulation over the winds of magic. Each tier also adds a bonus to the characters abilities (+5 to +50). Magic abilities range from manipulating magical winds, creating effects like storms, summoning magical constructs, warping reality, to becoming a godlike being with control over elements.

Faith: Players cast spells by channeling their deity's power. The process involves rolling a number of d10s equal to the player's Magick/Faith. If the total is equal to or greater than the miracle’s Casting Hits (CH), the spell is successfully cast. Overcasting occurs when a die rolls a ten; this causes an escalation of Divine Wrath for each additional Casting Check.

Divine Wrath: When players overcast or all dice roll a one, they risk incurring Divine Wrath. This could manifest in various ways, such as damage to the player, the loss of items, or the summoning of demons.

Spontaneous Miracles: Players can create Spontaneous Miracles by combining one of three techniques with a Presence of a God they worship. These techniques include "I Bless...", "I Curse...", and "I Commune...".

God-Stain: God-Stains are marks left by the gods on their devotees. Players gain a God-Stain for every two miracles they learn. These can grant various benefits or penalties based on the deity's presence.

Gods and Miracles

Bygorr, the God Hunter: Devotees of Bygorr have abilities related to survival and nature. The miracles of Bygorr include granting weapons, senses of the wild, speed, and the ability to command the wild.

Corvis, the God Thief: Corvis grants miracles related to luck and trickery. These can force targets to take additional actions, hide the user, enable theft, or increase luck.

Implementing in Foundry VTT

For implementing in Foundry VTT, each of these mechanics would need to be built out. You would need to:

Create character sheets that include fields for Magick/Faith and a space to track Divine Wrath and God-Stains.
Define the miracles for each God, listing them along with their Casting Hits (CH) values and effects.
Create a table for Divine Wrath outcomes that can be easily referenced during gameplay.
Set up an option for Spontaneous Miracles, allowing players to select a technique and a Presence to generate new effects.
Generate systems to manage the God-Stain mechanic, allowing players to earn and track these marks and their effects.
