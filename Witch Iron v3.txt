"Witch Iron" is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) designed by Ethan Rowe with influences from other legendary games such as Zweihander, Dungeon Crawl Classics, The Burning Wheel, and more.

Core Mechanics:

Conflict Resolution: This includes 'Whateverâ€™s Reasonable' (no roll needed if the outcome is reasonable), 'Ability or Skill Check' (roll for binary outcomes), and 'Quarrel' (roll for detailed or multiple outcomes).

Checks: Success is achieved by rolling percentile dice under a Skill or Ability. The tens digit of the roll on success becomes your number of hits (+ Hits). Failure is determined by rolling over the Skill or Ability, with the tens digit subtracted from your Skill or Ability to determine your number of hits.

Quarrels: Used to resolve conflicts. Parties agree on the terms, make a contested check, and then resolve the argument. The result depends on the net hits (-1 for failure, 0 to 2 for victory at a cost, and 3+ for clear victory).

Everything Wants to Kill You: The environment is an adversary, with hazards and goals that present minor to major quarrels. These include enemies, wilderness, storms, cities, diseases, and personal necessities like food, water, and sleep.

The Dark Descent: Players' lineages are doomed to demonic corruption. Players have the opportunity to learn a part of the demon's true name each generation, with the goal of either serving the dark gods or defeating the demon by learning its full name. Mechanisms include The Exchange (reroll any check with a cost), Naming the Beast (overcoming challenges to learn the demon's true name), Channel the Name (use the demon's powers), Damnation (transform into a powerful abomination at the cost of the descendant's soul), and the Ultimate Outcome (defeat or serve the demon).

The Bloody Axe: An example of a demon, boasting of fiery power and martial prowess. The demon's bloodline grants savage qualities and fear-inducing abilities. The demon has its own unique traits and influences which impact the player's character.

Creating a Foundry VTT System would require transferring these mechanics into a digital format, with automation for rolls, conflict resolution, tracking of demonic influences, and progression of the Dark Descent.
"Witch Iron" appears to be a Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) system, with a focus on demonic influence, true names, and character traits. The game involves demons, each possessing specific traits, and the discovery of their true names. The player characters are descendants of these demons and therefore have these traits.

Here's a summary:

Demonic Traits and Influence: Each demon has specific traits, and these are associated with a unique influence. Each demon also has a corresponding True Name that can be formed by choosing one option from each column (prefix, root, and suffix). The True Name is hidden and can be discovered in different ways.

Demon Examples: Some demons provided are:

"Demon of the Serpent of Vice" - known for temptation and indulgence.
"Demon of the Smiling Sickness" - spreads disease and decay.
Each demon has unique traits and influences, along with ways to discover its True Name.
Character Creation:

Step 1: Roll Starting Abilities (d20 ten times).
Step 2: Gain three Genetic Traits.
Step 3: Select two Lineages and add +10% to every listed Ability from each of your Lineages.
Luck: Players can spend Luck to modify their Check rolls or to escape a dangerous situation. At the end of every session, players gain a d10 Luck, up to 100.

Max Encumbrance: Over-encumbered characters suffer speed and check penalties.

Starting Abilities: Characters have primary and secondary abilities, including Muscle, Robustness, Agility, Quickness, Finesse, Intelligence, Willpower, Personality, and Luck.

Max Contacts/Followers: Characters have a maximum limit of Contacts (NPCs who indirectly assist) and Followers (NPCs who directly assist).

Skills and Specializations: Characters possess skills, each with different Specialization examples. Characters can gain bonus hits on successful checks within their specialization.

To create a Foundry VTT system from this, you would need to implement the various elements mentioned above, including the character creation rules, the skills, specializations, and the demonic traits and influences. Each demon could be a separate entity with its related traits, influence, and True Name mechanisms. The demonic influence could be modeled as conditions or effects applied to characters. The character sheet would need to accommodate for primary and secondary abilities, luck, encumbrance, contacts/followers, skills, and specializations.
Creating a Foundry VTT system for the "Witch Iron" TTRPG would involve programming and setting up various game mechanics, such as character traits, lineages, and descendant progression.

Here's a summary of the key elements:

Genetic Traits: These traits influence a character's abilities, and there are different traits for various aspects like Intelligence, Personality, Robustness, Finesse, Lifespan, Agility, Quickness, Luck, Willpower, Speed, and Magick or Faith. Each trait has a range (e.g., 25-32 for the "Dimwitted/Natural-Leader" trait, which influences Intelligence) and can be either increased or decreased by a certain percentage or value. The trait gained depends on if the roll is even or odd.

Passing Genes: Descendants can inherit their progenitor's genetic traits with a 50% chance or roll for a new trait. The order of the traits is significant.

Lines of Lineage: Each player chooses two lines of lineage that impact abilities (e.g., Academic, Alchemist, Black-Thumb, etc.). Each lineage provides bonuses to specific abilities and begins with two lineages unlocked. There are also unlockable lineages, which require fulfilling certain conditions.

Writing Your Book of Bones: Each descendant is recorded with a unique name and title based on their deeds or aspects of their life.

Starting and Unlockable Lineages: Each lineage provides unique bonuses and talents. To unlock a lineage, a descendant must gain all five lineage talents or complete a lineage-specific quest.

Lineage Projects: Each lineage can start a project (e.g., Academic's University, Alchemist's Guild), which provides benefits to the lineage descendants. The project's scale depends on the silver spent.

Lineage Talents: Each lineage has unique talents (e.g., Forbidden Inspiration for Academics, Devilâ€™s Brew for Alchemist) which provide unique abilities or bonuses.

This system also includes elements like Descendant's life's work projects, which are only completed when a descendant dies, and each lineage has unique names for its guilds or institutions. All these aspects would need to be implemented in the Foundry VTT system.

Talents
Quick Fixer: Once per session, allows prototyping inventions at a rate of 1 research point per minute and round instead of the usual 1 week and 1 day.
Contingency Plan: Once per session, allows pulling out any item up to one encumbrance after a trade check.
Explosive Device: Once per session, doubles effective research points when creating a new single-use weapon invention.
Perfectionist: Adds Tier in +Hits to crafting for a new Invention. Suffers one Stress for each Invention crafted this way.
Lineages
Black-Thumb: Invention-focused lineage. Can form a league of inventors and blacksmiths. Has costs and benefits depending on the league's rating.
Pit-Born: Combat-focused lineage. Can form a "Pit" for fighting. Has costs and benefits depending on the Pit's rating.
Ordained: Faith-focused lineage. Can construct a Temple. Has costs and benefits depending on the Temple's rating.
Shadow: Deception-focused lineage. No specific structure mentioned.
Lineage Unlocking Conditions
Black-Thumb: Submit a unique & impressive invention or die in defense of/conquer a League.
Pit-Born: Become champion of a Pit by defeating the current champion or die in defense of/conquer a Pit.
Ordained: Become ordained by donating a lost holy relic or die in defense of/conquer a Temple.
Descendants
Descendants can contribute to the league, pit, or temple of their lineage.
Descendants can earn +1 Tier by spending double training time.
Descendants can undertake lineage-specific projects that are completed upon their death.
Lineage-Specific Projects
Black-Thumb (Workshop): Allows creation of a Master Invention, a high-tier invention without any quirks.
Pit-Born (Uprising): Allows for the destruction of a Project or the gathering of a Warband.
Ordained (Sainthood): Allows creation of a holy relic that can cast miracles known by the descendant.
Costs and Benefits
Each lineage, league, pit, or temple has a rating system that determines its size, cost, and benefits. This should be implemented as a progression system in Foundry VTT.
Here's the summarization for creating a Foundry VTT system from the "Witch Iron" TTRPG:

Silver Cost and Scale: This refers to the cost in silver and the size of organizations. For example, a "Cutpurse Hideout" costs 1,000 silver and is of scale 1, while "The Dark Council" costs 512,000 silver and is of scale 10.

Syndicate Names: These are the possible names of syndicates, rolled on a d6.

Projects and Networks: Players can dedicate their life to a project for their lineage. A project's completion occurs upon the death of the player's character. Projects have costs associated with their tiers, which increase with each level.

Lineage Abilities and Talents: Characters from specific lineages gain bonus percentages to certain abilities and have access to specific talents. For example, a Witch gains +10% to Agility, Willpower, Personality, and Luck and can learn talents like Circle of Power or Fueled by Corruption.

Unlocking Lineages: Players can add specific lineages to their line by completing tasks, like joining a coven for the Witch lineage or passing a strength trial for the Workhorse lineage.

Lineage Projects: Lineage-specific projects offer benefits that stack with each rating. For instance, the Witch lineage has the Coven project, and the Workhorse lineage has the Club project.

Advancement: Characters earn one XP per silver spent. XP can be used to deepen bonds with the character's line, indulge in vices, work on legacy projects, crafting, trading, or training.

Training: Training allows characters to learn new talents, gain advancement points, and gain skill specializations. Training requires three months per tier and the total XP increases with each tier.

All these elements can be translated into Foundry VTT system modules, including elements like character sheets, dice rolling systems, and databases for syndicate names, lineage abilities, talents, and projects.
Witch Iron is a TTRPG with character progression that spans from Level 8 (Elite, 50,800 XP) to Level 10 (Living Legend, 409,200 XP).

Alchemy: Alchemists brew Concoctions using gathered ingredients. The process includes gathering ingredients, selecting effects based on Tier & Essence, and concocting for a week per Tier of effects. The result is a crude Concoction with a Toxicity level. This can be refined by making Research & Trade checks, reducing Toxicity per Hit. Concoctions have an instant effect or linger for d6 rounds, and can be extended at higher Tiers. After drinking, an Imbibe Check is made, subtracting Toxicity from Hits. If this results in 0 or less, the character suffers 1 Corruption. Concoctions are made from various Essences, each offering different effects and requiring different ingredients.

Inventing: Black-Thumbs can create Inventions. The process includes gathering ingredients (50s or 100s worth per Tier), selecting effects, and inventing for a week per Tier of effects. The result is a crude Invention with Quirks. This can be refined by making Research & Trade checks, reducing Quirks per Hit. Inventions can have different effects based on their type (Melee Weapons, Ranged Arms, Armor, Small Inventions).

Spell Writing: Those controlling Wicked Wind can write Spells. The process includes gathering ingredients (100s worth per Tier), selecting effects, and writing for a week per Tier of effects. The result is a crude spell with Quirks. This can be refined by making Research & Trade checks, reducing Quirks per Hit. Spells require Casting Hits to activate and can have different effects based on the Wicked Wind used.

Miracle Working: Devotees of a God can work Miracles. The process includes gathering ingredients (100s worth per Tier), selecting effects, and working for a week per Tier of effects. The result is a crude Miracle with Quirks. This can be refined by making Research & Trade checks, reducing Quirks per Hit. Miracles require Casting Hits to activate.

For Foundry VTT, this game would require modules for character progression, alchemy, inventing, spell writing, and miracle working, each with its unique mechanics and requirements.
