Conflict Resolution
There are three main methods of resolving conflicts.
* Whatever’s Reasonable: If a conflict does not have a meaningful consequence or the solution would reasonably work, then don’t roll; it just works.
* Ability or Skill Check: If a conflict has a binary outcome or brevity is desired, make a Check, possibly modified by the situation.
* Quarrel: If a conflict has many possible outcomes or a detailed outcome is desired, make a Quarrel.
Dice Terminology
* + Hits: After succeeding on a Check, add Hits to the total.
* Doubles: Rolling the same number for the units and tens dice.
* ExplodingE: When you roll the maximum result on a die, roll it again and use the total. 
* Extended Check: Multiple linked checks, building up to a number of Hits.
* Reverse: Swaps the tens and units die before roll modifications from Luck.
Scope of Checks
When you make a Check, use whatever the result is for all related checks until the situation meaningfully changes. Basically, you should only roll once for a given Check (i.e., Picking a Lock, you either pick it or you can’t).


There are some obvious exceptions to this rule, for example, combat. 
Player Agency
After a Check that fails, the player should be given the choice of at least two potential outcomes (I.e., vs. Picking a Lock, failure: I can’t pick this lock, or I can but I alert enemies).
Checks
You succeed on a Check by rolling percentile dice (d100 or 2d10) using one for the ten’s die and the other for the unit’s die, equal to or under a Skill or Ability; if you roll over, you fail.

On a success, use the result of the tens die as your number of hits on success. So, if you passed a check with a roll of 42, you score +4 Hits. 

On a failure, subtract the result of the tens die from the tens unit of your Skill or Ability as your number of Hits. So, if you failed a check with a roll of 63 and had a 56 in the Skill, you scored -1 Hit.

Doubles are Critical Hits on a successful check and are Fumbles on a failed check.

If you roll 01-05, you always get a Critical Hit, and if you roll 95-00, you always get a Fumble.


Critical Hits and Fumbles always grant a total of +/-6 Hits for your Check.

Quarrels
A system to resolve conflicts quickly. This can be any dispute, such as bartering, preventing a wolf attack, finding a new contact, interrogation, swaying an audience, manipulation, chases, or even combat.
* Agree to Terms, 
“If I win, you'll do ... If you win, I'll do...“
* Make a Contested Check
* Resolve the Argument 
   * Net Hits: -1, Failure
   * Net Hits: 0 to 2, Victory at a Cost
   * Net Hits: 3+, Victory
LingeringL Quarrels
If a Quarrel is Lingering, record its name, ability percentage & Hit bonus. It will then instigate a Quarrel at set intervals.
Lingering
	Set Interval
	Removed By:
	Disease
	When you Sleep.
	Defeating in a Quarrel, Cure
	Need Deprived*
	After Time Interval.
	Fulfilling Needs
	*Also escalates by 20% & +1 Hits at each interval.
Scope of Quarrels
When making a Quarrel, use whatever the result is for all related checks until the situation changes. You should only roll once for a given Quarrel (i.e., vs. Cliff, “If I win, I’ve climbed up”; use this for the entire climb).
Player Agency
After a Quarrel that ends in a Compromis, the player should always be given the choice of at least two potential outcomes (I.e., vs. Cliff on a -2 Hits the choice between falling part way down, suffering 2d6 damage, or losing their sword).
Compromise Examples
Here are examples to help you adjudicate Quarrels. Don’t take these as hard rules; make them your own.

	d6 x 10 Silver
	d6 x 50 Silver
	*Delayed by Days / Weeks / Months depending on the length of the journey.
Group Quarrels
When a group is involved in a Quarrel, you have two ways of resolving it. 
   * Each character in the group individually Checks against a single opposed Check (i.e., vs. Cliff “If I win, I climbed up”).

The Dark Descent
Your lineage is doomed to corruption by one of the many demons of the dark gods. You choose which demon will corrupt their lineage, each one with their own unique powers and goals. Each generation, the players have the opportunity to learn a part of the demon's true name. The ultimate goal of the lineage is to either serve the dark gods or to truly defeat the demon by learning its true name and manifesting it.
Why?
The demon seeks to corrupt the descendants to gain their loyalty and use them as pawns in their eternal struggle against the other dark gods. The demon may be seeking to escape its own prison or curse, and corrupting the descendants is a way of doing so. The demon may also see the descendants as a way to gain access to the mortal realm.
The Exchange
Players can choose to use The Exchange to reroll any check, but it comes at a cost. You will not be able to use the exchange again until you roll on your demonic influence table.
Naming the Beast
Each generation, players can go to the edges of sanity and overcome challenges to gain a part of the demon's true name. The challenges are based on the type of demon the player's character has chosen. If you’re successful, roll on your true name table & demonic trait table tied to that word. Each generation can gain one part of the demon’s name. 
Channel the Name
If a descendant knows a part of the demon’s true name, they can channel the demon for special abilities based on the type of demon it is. Each word of the demon's true name is tied to one of the demon’s powers, and these powers can be used by making a Quarrel against one Hit per word known, or roll on your demonic influence table. 
Damnation
Damnation comes in two forms: losing one's mind or body to corruption or madness, or becoming an abomination. The abomination transformation is a powerful form granted by the demon, offering a boost of short-term power but at the cost of the descendant's soul. You may transform at any time, this is irreversible, and the descendant is damned forever. As an abomination, they have full access to all known demonic traits and use 5 Hits as their roll for any Check. If a descendant is damned, they can be used by the demon beyond their natural lifespan.
The Ultimate Outcome
The lineage is doomed to serve the dark gods or to truly defeat the demon by learning its true name and gaining control over it. Once your line has learned all eight parts of the demon's true name, you may shout its full name, summoning the demon to overcome it directly. This will be a battle between the player's character and the demon, the outcome of which will determine the fate of the lineage.


There are two ways this battle can happen:


   1. The demon will claim the line if eight of the descendants are corrupted. Manifesting itself to directly claim the last descendant. If the demon wins, the line is damned, but if you defeat it, your line’s fate is delayed until the next descendant falls to the darkness.
   2. You may choose to fight the demon using the true name, if you win, the line dominates the demon, gaining full access to its powers and never having to roll on the demonic influence table again. If the descendant loses, they become damned.


The end result will depend on the choices the player's character makes throughout the game.

Character Creation
The gods are cruel, and danger is everywhere. Here are the three steps for creating a Descendent. It is recommended to roll your next Descendent as well. 


   * Step 1: Roll Starting Abilities. Roll d20 ten times; then assign to any ability requiring a d20.
   * Step 2: Gain three Genetic Traits.
   * Step 3: Select two Lineages available to your line, and add +10% to every listed Ability from each of your Lineages.
Luck
The fates are capricious, callous, as likely to grant you success in your endeavors as they are to consign you to a terrible fate. Luck is spent in two ways:
   1. After a Check is rolled, you may spend it at a one-to-one ratio to raise or lower your roll.
   2. You may spend 50 Luck to safely escape the situation. 


Luck Checks may be rolled to decide random events. At the end of every session, you gain a d10 Luck, up to 100. 
Max Encumbrance
Your back is killing you and your limbs are slow. You need to drop some weight before you move. When you exceed your Max Encumbrance in carried items, you suffer the following effects.
   * Past 1x Enc: 1/2 Speed, -20% to all Checks.
   * Past 2x Enc: No Speed, -40% to all Checks.
Instant Access Items
You pull the dagger out of its sheath with a swift motion, before driving it into their eye socket. You may wield these items without using an action.
Magick / Faith
Beware the horrors of this ancient and eldritch power. You may only have one of these two abilities.

  Passing Genes
The laws of nature are written in runes of flesh and blood. You cannot change these laws. For the first Descendant in a Line of Lineage or when a Descendant is indirectly related, roll three Genetic Traits (rerolling duplicates) and record these in order in Genetic Trait slots 1, 2 & 3. 


A Descendant has a 50% chance of gaining their Progenitor’s Genetic Trait for slots 1, 2 & 3. Otherwise, roll a random Genetic Trait for that slot.


When rolling for a Genetic Trait, check if the roll is even or odd. When even, gain the Base Trait, and when odd, gain the Duality Trait.

Combat & Injury
Rounds & Initiative
Bloodthirsty warriors are circling your flanks, the life-sapper and his demonic allies look on eagerly. At the start of Combat roll d6.
   * On a 1-3 the opponents go first.
   * On a 4-6 the party goes first.


In any order, every combatant on a side may take one Action (Attacking, Sprinting (x2 Move), Casting, etc…) & Move (up to your Speed Ability).
Melee Combat
The sound of steel clashing, the blinding flurry of metal. When attacking while you’re Engaged, make a Melee Quarrel. Your opponent may defend against you with Melee or Light-Foot.
   * If your Net Hits are +0 or more, you Injure your opponent. 
   * If your Net Hits are -1 or less, your opponent Injures you when using Melee or simply dodges the blow when using Light-Foot.
Ranged Combat
The iron arrowhead pierced the flesh, sending a shower of blood over the walls before it slumped to the ground. When attacking while you’re not Engaged, make a Ranged Quarrel. Your opponent may defend with Light-Foot.
   * If your Net Hits are +0 or more, you Injure your opponent. 
   * If your Net Hits are -1 or less, they dodge.
Hit Location
A silky, spiked needle pierces your skin, the warped metal tip embedding in your arm. When you strike someone with an attack, the defender decides the hit location. The attacker may spend two Hits to move the attack one hit location away.

Injury
The blade drives deep into their flesh, causing blood to gush from the open wound. Use the following steps when inflicting an injury:
   * Consult the appropriate hit location table. 
   * Determine the Injury location using the Units die of your attack or roll d10 
   * Determine severity of the Injury with your Net Damage: (Weapon Dmg + Net Hits) - (AV+RB).
Critical Hit
A satisfying Crack sounds as your hammer smashes their skull. If you roll a Critical Hit, use +6 Hits as the roll or gain +1 Hit for your Check. Also, increase the Injury you inflict by d6E.
Fumbles
The cold, spattering mud was everywhere, clinging to your legs like a skin. If you roll a Fumble, use -6 Hits as the roll for your Check, you also fall Prone.
Battle Wear
Your blade is starting to blunt and your armor is covered in battle scars. You may increase the Damage of a single attack by clipping your weapon’s damage by one for one Damage. You may also increase your Soak for a single attack by dentting your armor’s AV by one for +d6 AV.
Advanced Combat
Giving Ground
You dive to the side, narrowly avoiding the crashing axe. When dodging an attack, you may give ground to your opponent, this grants you a +2 Hits bonus to Light-Foot Checks, but you move ten feet away from them in the direction of their choice. If you do this on two Checks in a row, you fall Prone instead.
Example Actions:
Charge
When you charge in a straight line to an opponent & howl a battle cry, you +2 Hits to your Attack.
Brace
When you use an action to take a defensive stance, you gain a  +2 Hits to defensive Checks until your next round. However, you cannot inflict damage.
Sprinting
When you use an action to run faster, you may move up to x2 your Speed instead of x1 your Speed.
Fall Damage
The ground drops below your feet and you're falling. Your heart thuds in your chest as you try to comprehend what just happened, but it's too late. When you fall, every 10ft inflicts a cumulative d6 damage to the body part that strikes the ground first.

Cover
Laying low in a hidden position, you clutch your metal shield. When a hit location is behind cover, any attack that would strike this hit location hits the cover instead.
Engagement & Overwhelm
A foul smell emerges, as the undead swarm around you. You are outnumbered and surrounded by your enemies.
   * You are Engaged if you are within 5ft of an opponent. 
   * Disengaging gives an opponent a free attack, or you may take action to disengage freely.
   * You Overwhelm opponents when your side has more combatants in an engagement.
   * 2:1 grants a +20% bonus.
   * 3:1 grants a +40% bonus.
   * 4:1 grants a +60% bonus.
Mounted Combat
Your steed thunder across the battlefield, it’s hooves trampling the corpses of the slain. When you are mounted, use the following rules:
   * Gain your mount’s Size bonus to Damage Roll & Cavalry Weapon Qualities on a Charge.
   * Use your mount’s Speed instead of your own.
   * You may defend against attacks to your mount with a -20% penalty.

Magick
When you want to cast a spell, you must draw upon the power of the Wicked Winds and focus it on your desired effect. Using an action to Cast, roll up to your Magick in d10s. If the result is equal to or greater than the spell’s Casting Hits, it is cast successfully.  If the result exceeds the spell’s CH, you may continue to make Cast Checks in an Extended Check until the spell is cast. 
Curse of the Wicked Winds
You feel the eldritch energies coiling and twisting inside you, just waiting to be released. You escalate your miscast by one step for each Casting Check rolled after the first. This accumulates until you have cast your spell or ended it prematurely.
         1. Petty Miscast 
         2. Great Miscast
         3. Cataclysmic Miscast, adding +5 to the roll on the table for each additional step
The Apprentice’s Folly
If all of your dice roll a one, your spell automatically fails, and worse still, you escalate your Miscast by three steps.
A Slow Death
If you decide that you do not want to roll your Miscast, then you gain Corruption equal to double the steps of your Miscast. 
Spellcasting Modifiers
If any effects would hamper speech or movement but not mute or immobilize (i.e., being Deafened), receive a -1 to each casting Check; for every -10%, you would have to Check & -1 per AV of the most armored location.
________________
Spontaneous Spells
The Wicked Winds are a dangerous and malleable force. To create a Spontaneous Spell, begin by making a sentence with one of the three techniques, and combine it with a Domain of a wind you control.
         * “I Create …”
         * e.i. Creating or Summoning
         * “I Purge …”
         * e.i. Destroying or Banishing
         * “I Command …”
         * e.i. Controlling or Transforming


Spontaneous casting starts at CH 0; with every ten Hits rolled, you may add effect, using the following table as guidelines.

Cruel Gods

It is the End Times, the Dark God’s machinations will come to fruition, and the setting will meet its doom. The group should decide what form this inevitable end will take and how much time is left, typically 100, 200, or 300 years. Use the following table for ideas, or create your own.

	5
	A Great Divinity falls, and the impact of their body scourges the land
	6
	The First Lich awakes, cursing every corpse to rise as a frenzied servant.
	7
	The Seven Seals are broken, each one bringing doom to the land.
	8
	The Sun is snuffed out, life no longer grows, and madness rules.
	9
	The Dance of Death grips the land, spreading to all who witness.
	10

            1. Continue? Your Lines survive into the new Post-Apocalyptic landscape.
            2. New Game+ Your Lines are sent back to begin again, starting with any two Lineages you’ve unlocked
