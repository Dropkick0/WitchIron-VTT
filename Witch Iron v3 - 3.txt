In creating a Foundry VTT system, you would create a data structure for each weapon which includes its name, encumbrance, price, damage modifier, and any qualities & flaws it has. For weapon qualities, create an object that maps the name of the quality to its effects. This can be used to apply effects during combat. Ranges would be used to determine how far a weapon can be effectively used.
Here's a summarized outline for creating a Foundry VTT system based on the Witch Iron TTRPG. Please note that Foundry VTT allows for custom data systems, so you might need to adapt this information to fit with your specific usage and requirements.
